# pandadoc-api-helper

* I have created this helper class to embed digial signature into a pdf file I have. I need to perform a list of operation on a pdf which includes
* 1. Add a digital signature button a an already created invoice.
* 2. Customer could sign that pdf by clicking on Panda doc sign button.
* 3. Once pdf is signed I would like to download that signed pdf file.


## You can do all these operation easily with this helper as I struggled for a few days to figure it out.

I hope this will help.

thanks!
